# Recommendation System

Welcome to the **Recommendation System** repository! This project demonstrates the development of a personalized recommendation engine that provides tailored suggestions based on user preferences and behaviors. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to recommend items such as movies, products, or services, enhancing user experience and engagement.

## Features
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggest items based on user-item interactions.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommend items based on content similarity.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine both collaborative and content-based methods for improved accuracy.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Generate suggestions tailored to individual user preferences.
- **Streamlit Integration**: A user-friendly web interface to visualize and interact with the recommendation engine.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Surprise (for collaborative filtering)
- Flask (for backend integration)
- Streamlit (for web interface)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suyashb45/recommendation-system.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use
1. Prepare your dataset with user-item interactions.
2. Train the recommendation model by running `train_model.py`.
3. Use `recommend.py` to generate recommendations for a user.
4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   The Streamlit interface will open in your browser, allowing you to interact with the recommendation system and see personalized suggestions.
